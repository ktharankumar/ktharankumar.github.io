One of his best qualities that I came across is his communication of ideas or explaining his thought process. His ideas and explanations are all communicated effectively. A great team player and always a learner. During programming collaborations, working alongside him was amazing. Logic discussions, design constraints and idea implementation discussions, all were very effective and impactful. Another quality is his attention to detail, so certain facts or statements or ideas that don't immediately strike, he is able to think about it and derive valuable conclusions and questions. All in all just an amazing person to work with. Highly recommended!"</p>

		<p> I’ve worked with Tharani on a few projects, and one thing that always stood out was his ability to stay calm and focused under pressure. Whether we were troubleshooting last-minute issues or brainstorming ideas, he was always dependable and sharp.
		He’s great at what he does and brings a thoughtful, steady energy to the team. I learned a lot from working with him and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him to any team looking for someone who gets the job done.

		<p> Tharani Kumar is a great colleague and a good friend of mine. One of his best qualities that I came across is his communication of ideas or explaining his thought process. His ideas and explanations are all communicated effectively. A great team player and always a learner. During programming collaborations, working alongside him was amazing. Logic discussions, design constraints and idea implementation discussions, all were very effective and impactful. Another quality is his attention to detail, so certain facts or statements or ideas that don't immediately strike, he is able to think about it and derive valuable conclusions and questions. All in all just an amazing person to work with. Highly recommended!</p>
